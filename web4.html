<h2>What is UPS ?</h2>
 <b>Uninterruptible power supply</b>, UPS is a hardware device that provides a backup power source in case of a power outage (blackout), brownout, or a surge in power. A UPS provides enough power to prevent unsaved work from being lost with a power failure by allowing the user to save work and shut down. If the outage is short, the computer remains running during the outage. The picture shows an APC battery backup power strip.

<h2>How would having a UPS help a computer?</h2>
Having your computer connected to a UPS protects it from electrical surges and outages. When computers shut down improperly, such as when a power outage happens, it can damage the computer's internal parts and cause lost data. Having a UPS helps prevent the computer from being improperly shut down and helps protect the computer and its data. 
<h2>What are the types of UPS?</h2>
There are three versions of the UPS: standby UPS, online UPS, and line-interactive UPS. With a standby UPS (offline UPS), the UPS switches to battery power when the power problem occurs. With an online UPS, the UPS always provides power from the battery, and while they offer better protection, they are more expensive. For most home users and small businesses, a standby UPS will meet all their needs.
